# Excel Vanilla JS

A minimalist Excel-like spreadsheet built using **vanilla JavaScript**.  
No frameworks — just clean, manual setup using **Webpack 5**, **Babel**, and **SCSS**.

## Features

✅ Custom Webpack 5 configuration
✅ SCSS support with hot reload
✅ Modern JavaScript via Babel (`@babel/preset-env`)
✅ Environment-specific builds (development & production)
✅ Hash-based filenames for cache busting
✅ Manual DOM manipulation (no libraries)
